#  This project has been deprecated in favor of the Node.js rewrite.
The discord.py implementation of this project has been deprecated since discord.py has ceased development. Discord.py's lead developer's announcement regarding the situation can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/Rapptz/4a2f62751b9600a31a0d3c78100287f1).

The project will continue but will instead be using Node.js through the discord.js library. [Hikari](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari), another Python library for the Discord API, was considered, however I have decided to rewrite the project in with discord.js due to its speed, documentation and my plans for future projects.

I was slightly unsatisfied with the time it took for the bot to respond to the user with images. JavaScript may prove to be a solution to this issue since it is inherently faster than Python. Moreover, from what I've read and tried so far, discord.js' documentation and guide is far superior to discord.py's. Finally, I do have a future webapp project in mind, so migrating to JavaScript is certainly not a bad idea to improve my skills.
